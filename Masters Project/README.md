# Masters Project - Simulating the early universe
I created a program that simulated the development of the early universe using Spectral Methods. The application made use of the numpy and scipy libraries to perform convolutions.

I haven't included all the python code, sections I have included:
 - Main Code 150126
 - Unit_Tester
 - GUI_new
 - module1_SetFourierSpace
 - module5_TimeEvolution
 - module9_initialspectrum
 
These should serve to illustrate my python ability.
