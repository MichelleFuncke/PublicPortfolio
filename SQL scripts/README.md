# SQL
I created various SQL server scripts to help analyze and consolidate data. As the scripts were created for my previous employer, I can't share the original scripts I created. However, the scripts made use of the following concepts:

 - Select statements
 - Insert statements
 - Where clauses
 - Order by and Group by clauses
 - Join statements
 - Rounding (Floor/Ceiling)
 - Sum/Count
 - Case statements
