A C# desktop application I created for Derivco. This tool allowed an Empirical tester to easily connect to a database to check:
 - the number of strategies a game needed to be tested on
 - the amount of hours needed to perform this testing

Notable programming components/strategies:
 - Test Driven Development (TDD)
 - C# to SQL connection and data manipulation
 - MVVM style data binding and UI manipulation
 - WPF component creation and styling
 - Classes, Interfaces and other OOD concepts
 - Application usage tracking using a SQL database

Original code unavailable as they are Derivco IP.
