A C# desktop application I created for Derivco. This tool allowed users to format raw Perfmon (Performance Monitor) data into and Excel file. This tool:
 - Converted from bytes to Mbytes
 - Reformatted Headers
 - Calculated averages
 - Created graphs which required little to no further editing by users

This tool was later developed to manipulate Visual Studio and Mobile (IOS and Android) performance data.
 
 Notable programming components/strategies:
 - Test Driven Development (TDD)
 - Classes, Interfaces and other OOD concepts
 - MVVM style data binding and UI manipulation
 - WPF component creation and styling
 - Application usage tracking using a SQL database

Original code unavailable as they are Derivco IP.

Contained in this project:
 - C#_Plot-Purrfect_8.0 (User Guide)
 - Videos detailing every process
 - Images of some of the windows in PP
 - Images of PP before theme and MVVM implementation
