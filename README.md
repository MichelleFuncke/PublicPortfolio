# Public Portfolio
## Introduction
Welcome to my Portfolio project. This project will combine information from multiple projects I have created:

List of projects:
 - [Empiric Grimoire](Empiric%20Grimoire/README.md)
 - [Plot-Purrfect](Plot-Purrfect/README.md)
 - [SQL](SQL%20scripts/README.md)
 - Python
 - [Masters Project](Masters%20Project/README.md)
 - [TicTacToe](TicTacToe/README.md)
 - [CrossWord](CrossWords/README.md)

## Empiric Grimoire
A C# desktop application I created for Derivco. This tool allowed an Empirical tester to easily connect to a database to check:
 - the number of strategies a game needed to be tested on
 - the amount of hours needed to perform this testing

Notable programming components/strategies:
 - Test Driven Development (TDD)
 - C# to SQL connection and data manipulation
 - MVVM style data binding and UI manipulation
 - WPF component creation and styling
 - Classes, Interfaces and other OOD concepts
 - Application usage tracking using a SQL database

Original code unavailable as they are Derivco IP.

## Plot-Purrfect
A C# desktop application I created for Derivco. This tool allowed users to format raw Perfmon (Performance Monitor) data into and Excel file. This tool:
 - Converted from bytes to Mbytes
 - Reformatted Headers
 - Calculated averages
 - Created graphs which required little to no further editing by users

This tool was later developed to manipulate Visual Studio and Mobile (IOS and Android) performance data.

## SQL
I created various SQL server scripts to help analyze and consolidate data. As the scripts were created for my previous employer, I can't share the scripts I created. However, the scripts made use of the following concepts:

 - Select statements
 - Insert statements
 - Where clauses
 - Order by and Group by clauses
 - Join statements
 - Rounding (Floor/Ceiling)
 - Sum/Count
 - Case statements

## Python
I have used Python to create mini projects.

## Masters Project - Simulating the early universe
I created a program that simulated the development of the early universe using Spectral Methods. The application made use of the numpy and scipy libraries to perform convolutions.

## TicTacToe
This project was created to showcase my C# skills:
 - WPF
 - Object-Orientated Programming
 - Testcases (TDD)
 - GUI data binding (pseudo-MVVM)

 ## CrossWord
This project was created to showcase my C# skills:
 - WPF
 - XML handling
 - Object-Orientated Programming
 - GUI data binding (pseudo-MVVM)
